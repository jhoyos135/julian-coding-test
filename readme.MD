# Notes

- I'm using class syntax to create each functionality method.
- I modify some of the html to include a modal for the edit, this way I wouldn't have to do it with javascript, otherwise the code would have gotten very large.
- I'm not saving any information to a database but I added comments where all that code would be added in each section and where it would be implemented.
- Some of the code would be refactor to work better with a database implementation, making an api request to a backend server.
- I'm also keeping all variables locally scoped so there might be some duplication.
- There is a message helper method for the validation as well when a contact is added.
- The validation is simple: When the inputs are empty and when the email is incorrect.
